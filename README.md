# webaudio

Generate audio streams (DSP) with functions in the browser. Compatible with [baudio](https://github.com/substack/baudio) functions. Works on webkits only, including iOS 6 mobile safari (see note below).

Your function will be called with the following arguments:

*Time (float)*
*Sample index* (integer)
*Input sample* (float), this will be zero if there is no input. See connecting nodes below.
// Midi commands: this is not implemented.
// Fundamental Frequency: this is not implemented either, just an idea for cases such as effects node chains
// Data Object : also not implemented.

As a helper, this module will write _SAMPLERATE on the window. You cannot change sampleRates in the web audio api as of yet. I tried writing a mock downsampler into webaudio, but it did not sound right. 

You function should return a float between [-1, 1]. See examples below.

To play around with it, do

```bash
npm install -g browserify opa
git clone https://github.com/NHQ/webaudio
cd webaudio
opa
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:11001
Edit entry.js and refresh

# usage

```bash
npm install webaudio
```

Simple use:
```js
var webaudio = require('webaudio')
  , tau = Math.PI * 2
  , frequency = 555
;

function sine(time, i){
  return Math.sin(time * tau * frequency)
}

var channel = webaudio(sine);

channel.play()
// later, channel.stop()

```
For more advanced use, pass an audioContext as the first argument. You then use the same audio context to connect and use other webaudio functions, or other HTML5 Web Audio API nodes. This module (webaudio) returns a wrapped up ScriptProcessorNode, which you can connect to other nodes, or, to the final audioContext.destination:

```js
var webaudio = require('webaudio')
  , tau = Math.PI * 2
  , frequency = 555
  , context = new webkitAudioContext();

function sine(time, i){
  return Math.sin(time * tau * frequency)
}

function gain(time, i, inputSample){
  return inputSample * 1 / 4 
}

var signal = webaudio(context, sine)
var gain = webaudio(context, gain)

signal.connect(gain);

path.connect(context.destination)

/*
setTimeout(function(){
  path.disconnect(); 	// path.stop()
  path.connect(recorder);
  recorder.connect(repeater);
  repeater.connect(audio.destination)
}, 1000)
*/
```

## Mobile Safari
On mobile safari webkit (iOS), you can only initiate web audio API sounds from within a user event context (at least the fist time...?). Ergo, channel.play(), or channel.connect(context.destination) must be called from inside an event callback.

iOS 5.x does not support the webkit that supports the web audio api.

#Methods

Whatever is on the 

## channel.play()
Start playing the sound. This connects the node to the master contexts destination for you.

## channel.stop()
Disconnects the node from the master

## channel.createSample(duration)
This helper method will run your function for as long as **duration**, in *samples*.

ie, 48000 =~ one second, depending on your sound card

This returns an [audioBuffer node](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AudioBuffer), which are what you use for precision timed samples and loops. So you could for instance write a script that creates 1 second samples for every note value, through your synth function.
